# Changelog


## Pokemon
Pokemon that were too weak or overpowered received some rebalancing. All movesets were updated.

Changes in stats, movepools and held items makes using unevolved Pokemon at higher levels more viable

Evolutions that require trading are replaced with a level evolution. Lowered evolution level for Pokémon that evolved at too high level (babies for example).

Pokémon gain extra stats over time if you don't evolve them. Unevolved Pokémon start weaker but slowly climb to be on par (or even better in certain stats) than their evolved forms

HP growth is less level-dependant

### Traits
New 'Traits' replacing DVs

These are similar to Abilities and can be seen in the stats screen

Each species has 4 possible traits it can have. Two common (30% each) and two a little more rare (20%)


## Wild
All Pokemon are obtainable

Levels of wild pokemon scale with badges

Pokemon can appear evolved if their level is high enough (for any Pokemon that evolves through leveling or happiness + Tyrogue)

Higher shiny chance (1/900) with better colors

Very minor boost to catch rate for all Pokemon

Wild Legendaries can be found at random as you gain more badges

### Shallow Water
Different Pokémon can be found by walking in shallow water. This replaces Fishing

## Moves
Over 50 new moves

Many moves rebalanced, some similar moves removed

Physical/Special split

## Items

Special Pokeballs are more effective. Fast ball and Moon ball x4 to x8, Net ball x3 to x4, Heavy Ball has a wider range. Ultra ball x2 to x3 and price adjusted to compensate.

Repels last twice as long (100, 200, 300 steps for each of the repel types). To compensate, they're 85% more expensive. Repels also ask if you want to auto-reaply.

  
## Battle
STAB is +33% instead of +50%. Random damage variation is 5% instead if 15%

Double weakness is 3x damage instead of 4x

No random crits for regular moves but increasing your crit chance works as normal

Lowering accuracy is slightly less effective. -1 lowers it by 20% instead of 25%

Gain EXP after catching a pokemon

Happiness is gained faster by battle

Trainers give 15% more exp

EXP gain changed based on the level difference between your Pokémon and the opponent's

## Trainers and Gym Leaders

Team composition and levels scale with badges. Their teams can change and their pokémon can evolve. They also scale based on your party's average level, so overleveling is less effective

AI tries to use stat up moves more smartly

A message lets you know if the opponent has a held item

Gyms have to be beaten in one go for any rewards. Leaving will reset the Gym

## Pokédex
The Pokédex shows much more information: Base stats, Egg group, Traits, Catch rate, Exp and Held items

The "Area" section will display Rare Nest locations if you found it or heard about it before. It also shows land and water encounters separately

A new "Moves" section shows learnset the for that pokémon. You onlock more information as you battle more pokémon

## Events

### Roaming Pokémon
Suicune added back as a roaming pokémon

The legendary birds can be unlocked to roam Kanto

Beating the Elite 4 will respawn previously caught roamers

The more roamers you catch, the less likely they are to run (don't run at all after 2)

### Breeding
On average, half as many steps for breeding

Eggs hatch faster, and hatch at level 1

Eggs get different color palettes

Traits can be passed to the egg

## Bug Fixes
Fixed [all of these common](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/docs/bugs_and_glitches.md) bugs

## Graphical
Redone battle UI and stats interface

Revamped tilesets for maps

All NPC sprites were remade

Lower case names

Many Pokemon sprites have had their normal colors and shiny colors updated

Some back sprites were made bigger to show more of the Pokemon

## Misc
Faster pokecenters, berry tree messages, and "forget move" messages

Morning starts at 6AM instead of 4AM, making Night last 10 hours and Day last 14 hours

New interface frames to choose from

"Instant" text speed option and "alway run" movement speed

If a wild pokemon has a held item, the game will tell you, same for trainer battles.

Several moves can be used in the place of HMs. Surf and Fly can be learned from tutors
