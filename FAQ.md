25% chance of 10, 18% chance of 9, 6% chance of 8 to 2 and 12% chance of 1
Evolutions that require trading are replaced with a level evolution

# Moves

Physical/Special split
# Items
Special Pokeballs are more effective. Fast ball and Moon ball x4 to x8, Net ball x3 to x4, Heavy Ball has a wider range. Ultra ball x2 to x3 and price adjusted to compensate.
Special Pokeballs sell for more.
Fast Ball also works on Abra.
Repels last twice as long (100, 200, 300 steps for each of the repel types). To compensate, they're 85% more expensive. Repels also ask if you want to auto-reaply.
Type boost items add 20% damage instead of 10%.
Berries sell for more.
